/**
 * This exception signals the caller that the operation could not continue because a CPU-intensive operation (typically a TLS
 * handshaking) needs to be executed and the {@link TlsChannel} is configured to not run tasks. This allows the application to run
 * these tasks in some other threads, in order to not slow the selection loop. The method that threw the exception should be
 * retried once the task supplied by {@link #getTask()} is executed and finished.
 *
 * <p>This exception is akin to the SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC error code used by OpenSSL (but note that in OpenSSL, the task is
 * executed by the library, while with the {@link TlsChannel}, the calling code is responsible for the execution).</p>
 *
 * @see <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_get_error.html">
 * OpenSSL error documentation</a>
