/**
 * This exception signals the caller that the operation cannot continue because bytesProduced need to be write to the underlying
 * {@link ByteChannel}, the channel is non-blocking and there are no buffer space available. The caller should try the operation
 * again, either with the channel in blocking mode of after ensuring that buffer space exists.
 *
 * <p>For {@link SocketChannel}s, a {@link Selector} can be used to find out when the method should be retried.</p>
 *
 * <p>Caveat: Any {@link TlsChannel} I/O method can throw this exception. In particular, <code>read</code> may want to write data.
 * This is because TLS handshakes may occur at any time (initiated by either the client or the server).</p>
 *
 * <p>This exception is akin to the SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE error code used by OpenSSL.</p>
